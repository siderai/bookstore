made step by step after William S. Vincent's 'Django for professionals'.
I use this training app as template for practicing some advanced stuff

TODO:
1. Google auth (via django-allauth)
2. Yandex pay (set up and leave stubs)
3. Email confirmation (celery)
4. Custom permissions (admin panel)
5. Improve book search 
6. Add API (drf), therefore multiple frontend support
7. Migrate from django built-in cache to redis
8. Add books ;)
